# MERN Stack Todo Application with Authentication (Cookie-based) using Next.js

This repository contains a Todo application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and uses Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. Authentication is implemented using cookies.

## Features

- **Authentication**: User registration and login using cookies for session management.
- **Todo CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete Todos.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhanced performance and SEO benefits with Next.js.
- **API Routes**: Backend APIs using Express.js for handling Todo operations and authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based) for database storage.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAliashraf/NextJs-Todo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI = your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret_key
   URL= API URL
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server and the Express server concurrently.

5. **Access the application**:

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Todo application.

## Folder Structure

- **`/pages`**: Next.js pages for routing and SSR.
- **`/components`**: React components for UI elements.
- **`/api`**: Backend API routes using Express.js.
- **`/models`**: MongoDB models for Todo and User schemas.
- **`/utils`**: Utility functions such as authentication middleware and error handlers.

## API Routes

- `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `/api/auth/login`: Login and create a session using cookies.
- `/api/auth/logout`: Logout and destroy the session.
- `/api/todos`: CRUD operations for Todos (requires authentication).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for SSR and client-side rendering.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling API requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing Todos and User data.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication and session management.
